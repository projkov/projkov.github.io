When I finished the first note with my thoughts on FHIRPath.me, I found myself reflecting on how new changes could turn a lightweight service into something much larger.

I believe you don't need a complex tool to solve a simple problem. For instance, you don't need IDE-like functionality just to check FHIR resource data or to validate the structure of a resource in a StructureDefinition file. If you need help with an incorrect FHIRPath expression applied to a specific resource and want to share it with colleagues, you don’t need a lot of extra features for that either.

What I’m trying to say is, that I think the current state of FHIRPath.me is ideal for handling simple tasks. It’s fast, simple, and ready to use without any changes. Maybe I should keep the current app as a "light" version and continue developing a separate branch (or version) with more advanced functionality.

Best regards,
