Every time when I need to use the FHIRPath UI I faced with repeated problem - I don't have the history of the requests and expression executions.

Now this problem is fixed in the 1.1.0 version of the application. The history of the requests and executions is available. The list of features:

1. The history of requests with ability to check resulted resource, use this resource and use the URL;
2. The history of expression with ability to reuse them.

This update gives me an understanding of new features. Hope to provide new features soon.
