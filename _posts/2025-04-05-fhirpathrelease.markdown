I’ve decided to release version 1.0.0 of the FHIRPath UI. This app has stood the test of time—I still use it daily for anything related to FHIR resources. It’s fast, simple, and does exactly what it’s supposed to do.

However, there were a few things that used to be annoying: layout issues, the inability to use the Authorization header, and bad error handling. Those problems are now fixed, and I think it’s time to say: okay, it’s 1.0.0.

After this release, I have a few ideas for version 1.1.0, like a history of FHIRPath expressions and request history. I plan to add those features soon.

Hope you enjoy using this tool!
