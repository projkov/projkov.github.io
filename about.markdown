Hi, I'm **Pavel Rozhkov**.

I've been a **software developer since 2013**. My key tools are **TypeScript, Python, and PostgreSQL**. But I'm *not limited* to these tools, for example: now I have a lot of tasks with the Ruby language.

Since December 2017 I have been a proud *member* of the passionate, experienced team of developers - [Beda Software](https://beda.software). As a part of the team, I participate as a developer and consultant on a wide range of healthcare tasks. **I like my job and my team**.

I have a **bachelor's and master's** diploma in *Computer Science*. Also, I have an experience as a **PhD student** in *Computer Science*.

I am passionate about **programming and healthcare**, and **I hope to contribute to society through these fields**.

I enjoy spending my free time with family, and friends, and playing good video games.
